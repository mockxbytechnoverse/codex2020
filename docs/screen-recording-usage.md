   - The UI will show recording status and duration
   - Click "Stop Recording" to end the recording

### 2. Programmatic Recording via MCP Tools

```javascript
// Without description
await startScreenRecording();

// With description
await startScreenRecording({
  description: "Recording user checkout flow bug",
});
```

#### Stop Recording

```javascript
await stopScreenRecording();
```

#### Check Recording Status

```javascript
await getRecordingStatus();
```

## File Storage

### Default Location

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\[Username]\Downloads\mcp-recordings\`
- **macOS**: `/Users/[Username]/Downloads/mcp-recordings/`
- **Linux**: `/home/[Username]/Downloads/mcp-recordings/`

### File Format

- **Video**: WebM format with VP9 codec
- **Metadata**: JSON file with recording details
- **Naming**: `recording-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-mm-ss-SSS.webm`

### Metadata File Contents

```json
{
  "recordingId": "recording_123456_1234567890",
  "tabId": 123456,
  "description": "User provided description",
  "startTime": 1234567890000,
  "endTime": 1234567900000,
  "duration": 10000,
  "filename": "recording-2024-01-15T10-30-45-123.webm"
}
```

## Technical Details

### Permissions Required

The Chrome extension requires the following permissions:

- `tabCapture`: To capture tab content
- `activeTab`: To access current tab
- `tabs`: To interact with browser tabs

### Recording Settings

- **Resolution**: Up to 1920x1080
- **Frame Rate**: Maximum 30 FPS
- **Audio**: Enabled (captures tab audio)
- **Format**: WebM with VP9 video codec

### Limitations

1. Only one recording per tab at a time
2. Recording stops if the tab is closed
3. File size depends on recording duration and content
4. Requires active browser connection to MCP server

## Troubleshooting

### Recording Won't Start

- Ensure Chrome extension is installed and enabled
- Check that Browser Tools server is running
- Verify connection status in the extension panel
- Grant necessary permissions when prompted

### No Recording File Created

- Check the recordings folder exists and is writable
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Verify server logs for errors

### Poor Recording Quality

- Close unnecessary applications to free resources
- Reduce tab content complexity if possible
- Check system performance during recording

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Agent Integration**: Automatic recording analysis
2. **Recording Playback**: Built-in video viewer
3. **Compression Options**: Adjustable quality settings
4. **Batch Recording**: Multiple tab recording
5. **Cloud Storage**: Optional cloud backup

### Agent Workflow (Coming Soon)

When agent integration is complete:

1. Start recording with problem description
2. Reproduce the issue
3. Stop recording
4. Agent automatically analyzes:
   - Console logs during recording
   - Network requests
   - DOM changes
   - Visual issues
5. Receive AI-generated bug report and suggestions

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Bug Documentation

Record the exact steps to reproduce a bug, making it easier for developers to understand and fix issues.

### 2. User Testing

Capture user interactions to analyze UX problems and improve interface design.

### 3. Performance Analysis

Record page load and interactions to identify performance bottlenecks.

### 4. Training Materials

Create video tutorials showing how to use web applications.

### 5. Compliance Recording

Document user workflows for audit and compliance purposes.

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Issues

- **"Permission denied" error**: Try granting permission on a different website (avoid chrome:// pages)
- **No audio in recording**: Check that microphone button shows üé§ (not üîá)
- **Mixed audio not working**: Ensure browser allows audio context (some browsers require user interaction first)
- **Permission button stays red**: Clear browser data and try again, or check browser microphone settings

### Laser Pointer Issues

- **Laser button not responding**: Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
- **Red dot not visible**: Ensure recording is active and laser button is highlighted
- **Lines not drawing**: Try refreshing the page and starting a new recording
- **Performance issues**: Disable laser pointer if page becomes slow

### Recording Issues

- **Countdown interrupted**: Click anywhere to pause countdown, then click record button again
- **Recording bar missing**: Check if recording actually started, restart if needed
- **Desktop recording fails**: Ensure you select a screen/window in the browser dialog
- **Recording controls not working**: Try stopping and starting the recording again

## Best Practices

1. **Grant microphone permission early**: Set up microphone access before important recordings
2. **Test microphone toggle**: Verify audio is working before crucial recordings
3. **Use laser pointer sparingly**: Too many annotations can be distracting
4. **Let lines auto-fade**: Don't manually disable laser pointer unless needed
5. **Add descriptions**: Always add meaningful descriptions to help identify recordings later
6. **Keep recordings focused**: Record only what's necessary to keep file sizes manageable
7. **Clean up old recordings**: Regularly delete unneeded recordings to save disk space
8. **Monitor disk space**: Be aware of available storage, especially for long recordings

## API Reference

### MCP Tools

#### startScreenRecording(args)

Starts a new screen recording session.

**Parameters:**

- `args.description` (string, optional): Description of what's being recorded

**Returns:**

- Success message with recording ID
- Error message if recording fails

#### stopScreenRecording()

**Returns:**

- Success message with file path and duration
- Error message if no active recording

#### getRecordingStatus()

Gets the status of current recording session.

**Returns:**

- "No active recording session" if none

## Security Considerations

1. **Local Storage Only**: Recordings are stored locally, never uploaded
2. **No External Access**: Recording functionality requires local server connection
3. **Permission Based**: Chrome requires explicit user permission for tab capture
4. **Sanitized Metadata**: Sensitive data is not included in metadata files

## Support

For issues or feature requests related to screen recording:

1. Check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/browser-tools)
2. Review server logs for error messages
3. Ensure all components are up to date
